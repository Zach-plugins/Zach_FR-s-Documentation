# How do I set hook?

---
1. Open worth.yml in Sellwand plugin folder.
2. Change 'Hook' to your hook name. (ex. 'EconomyShopGUI' if I want to use EconomyShopGUI).
3. **RESTART** your server.

If is still now working after these steps, please open a support ticket on my discord server, including
link from /sellwanddebug
